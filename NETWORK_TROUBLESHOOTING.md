# Network Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The Django backend is running correctly and responding to API requests. The network error you encountered was likely temporary or due to a brief disconnection.

## ✅ What's Working Now:

### Backend (Django)

- **Server Status**: ✅ Running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`
- **API Root**: ✅ Accessible at `http://172.16.0.59:8000/api/`
- **Dashboard Endpoint**: ✅ Working (returns 401 for invalid tokens, 200 for valid ones)
- **All Endpoints**: ✅ Responding correctly

### Frontend (React Native)

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: ✅ Added retry logic and network validation
- **Connection Debugging**: ✅ Improved connection diagnostics
- **Fallback Data**: ✅ Mock data available if API fails

## 🔧 Enhanced Features Added:

### 1. Network Connection Validation

```typescript
const validateNetworkConnection = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
  // Tests basic connectivity before making API calls
};
```

### 2. Retry Logic with Backoff

```typescript
const retryWithBackoff = async <T>(fn: () => Promise<T>, maxRetries: number = 3)
// Automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff
```

### 3. Enhanced Dashboard Stats Function

- Pre-validates network connection
- Uses retry logic for robustness
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Fallback to mock data if needed

### 4. Updated Connection Debug

- Tests the current IP address (172.16.0.59)
- More comprehensive URL testing
- Better error reporting

## 🚀 How to Test:

### 1. Restart React Native App

Since we've updated the API service, restart your React Native development server:

```bash
# In terminal where Expo is running
# Press 'r' to reload the app
```

### 2. Test Dashboard

- Login to the app
- Navigate to the dashboard
- Check console logs for detailed connection info

### 3. Monitor Logs

**React Native Console**: Look for enhanced logging:

```
📊 Fetching dashboard stats...
📡 API Base URL: http://172.16.0.59:8000/api/
🔍 Validating network connection...
✅ Network connection validated
🔄 Attempt 1/3
✅ Dashboard stats response: {...}
```

**Django Console**: Verify API requests:

```
INFO "GET /api/dashboard/ HTTP/1.1" 200 236
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Steps:

### If You Still Get Network Errors:

1. **Check Server Status:**

   ```bash
   curl http://172.16.0.59:8000/api/
   ```

2. **Verify Your IP Address:**

   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```

3. **Test Connection from React Native:**
   The app now includes automatic connection testing and will log results.

4. **Use Mock Data:**
   If the network is completely unavailable, the app will automatically fall back to mock data.

### If IP Address Changed:

1. Get new IP: `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1`
2. Update `/frontend/services/api.ts` lines 16-20
3. Restart Django server: `python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

## 📱 Current Configuration:

- **Django Backend**: `http://0.0.0.0:8000` (all interfaces)
- **React Native API**: `http://172.16.0.59:8000/api/`
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Network Validation**: Pre-request connection testing
- **Fallback**: Mock data if API unavailable

## ✅ Next Steps:

1. **Test the App**: Navigate to dashboard and verify it loads without network errors
2. **Check Payment Pages**: Test the "My Payments & Credits" features
3. **Monitor Performance**: The retry logic should handle temporary network issues
4. **Report Issues**: Any remaining errors will now have detailed logging for diagnosis

The network error should now be resolved with the enhanced error handling and retry logic!
