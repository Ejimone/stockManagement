# ✅ NETWORK CONNECTION ISSUE RESOLVED!

## 🎉 Success Summary

The network connection issue has been **SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED**! Based on the latest logs, your React Native app is now connecting to the Django backend correctly.

## ✅ What's Working Now:

### 1. **Successful Login**

```
LOG  Login successful: {"access": "eyJhbGciOi...", "user": {"email": "generalbanx@gmail.com", ...}}
LOG  Sign-in successful, user data: {"email": "generalbanx@gmail.com", "full_name": "Evidence Evidence", "role": "Admin"}
```

```
LOG  Dashboard stats response: {"low_stock_products": 4, "total_products": 34, "total_revenue_this_month": 2270093.1, ...}
LOG  Admin dashboard: Stats fetched successfully
```

### 3. **Working Configuration**

- **Platform**: React Native (likely Android with Expo Go)
- **Working API URL**: `http://172.16.0.59:8000/api/`
- **Django Backend**: Running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` ✅
- **User Role**: Admin ✅

## 🔧 Configuration Fixed

The issue was that the app was trying different IP addresses in order:

1. ❌ `localhost:8000` - Failed (expected for React Native on device/emulator)
2. ❌ `127.0.0.1:8000` - Failed (expected for React Native on device/emulator)
3. ❌ `10.0.2.2:8000` - Failed (Android emulator specific, but you're using Expo Go)
4. ✅ `172.16.0.59:8000` - **SUCCESS!** (Your machine's actual IP address)

## 📱 Current Working Setup:

### Backend (Django):

- **Status**: ✅ Running on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0:8000`)
- **Accessible via**: `http://172.16.0.59:8000`
- **API Root**: `http://172.16.0.59:8000/api/`

### Frontend (React Native):
