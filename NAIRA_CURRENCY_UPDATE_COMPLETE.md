# ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ CURRENCY SYMBOL UPDATE - NAIRA (â‚¦) IMPLEMENTATION

## âœ… CHANGES COMPLETED

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary Change

**File:** `/frontend/utils/formatters.ts`

- **Before:** `currencySymbol: string = "$"`

2. **Sales Dashboard** (`/frontend/app/(sales)/dashboard/index.tsx`)

   - Updated local `formatCurrency` function to use `â‚¦` instead of `$`

3. **Test File** (`/frontend/test-price-formatting.js`)
   - Updated all test expectations from `$` to `â‚¦`

```
