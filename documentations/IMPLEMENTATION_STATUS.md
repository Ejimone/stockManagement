# Stock Management App - Implementation Status Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the current implementation status of the Django/React Native stock management application, specifically focusing on the "My Payments & Credits" and "Payment History" features.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Backend Implementation

- **Django API Endpoints**: All payment-related endpoints are working:
  - `GET /api/payments/` - List payments
  - `GET /api/payments/summary/` - Payment summary with calculations
  - `GET /api/payments/{id}/` - Payment details
  - `POST /api/payments/` - Create new payment

### 2. Frontend Payment Summary Page (`/frontend/app/(sales)/payments/index.tsx`)

- **Summary Cards**: Display key metrics:
  - Total Payments (from completed payments + sales amount_paid)
  - Outstanding Credits (unpaid + partial sales)
  - Recent Transactions (last 5 transactions)
  - Credits Over â‚¦1000 (if total outstanding > â‚¦1000)
- **Interactive Modals**: Each card opens a detailed modal with:
  - Filtered data based on card type
  - Proper data formatting
  - Scroll support for large lists

### 3. Frontend Payment History Page (`/frontend/app/(sales)/payments/history.tsx`)

- **Unified View**: Combines payment records and sales payments
- **Sorting Options**: By date (newest/oldest), customer name (A-Z/Z-A), amount (high/low)
- **Filtering Options**: By customer name, date range, amount range
- **Detail Modal**: Shows complete transaction details (read-only)

### 4. Navigation Structure (`/frontend/app/(sales)/payments/_layout.tsx`)

- **Tab Layout**: Easy navigation between Summary and History
- **Consistent Design**: Matches app's overall styling

### 5. Connection & Configuration

- **Backend Server**: Running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` (accessible from devices)
- **Frontend Configuration**: Updated to use correct local IP (`172.16.0.59`)
- **API Communication**: Verified working with test scripts

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes Made

1. **Payment Summary Calculations** in `/backend/salesperson/api_views.py`:

   ```python
   # Total payments calculation
   total_payments = Payment.objects.filter(
       sale__salesperson=user, status='completed'
   ).aggregate(Sum('amount'))['amount__sum'] or 0

   sales_amount_paid = Sale.objects.filter(
       salesperson=user
   ).aggregate(Sum('amount_paid'))['amount_paid__sum'] or 0

   total_payments += sales_amount_paid

   # Credits over 1000 calculation
   total_unpaid = unpaid_amount + partial_amount
   credits_over_1000 = total_unpaid if total_unpaid > 1000 else 0
   ```

2. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Frontend Changes Made

1. **API Integration**: Updated to use correct backend URL structure
2. **Data Processing**: Proper handling of payment and sales data
3. **UI Components**: Responsive cards, modals, and filtering interfaces
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network and API errors

## ðŸš€ Current Server Status

### Backend (Django)

- **Status**: âœ… Running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`
- **API Root**: Accessible at `http://172.16.0.59:8000/api/`
- **Health Check**: All endpoints responding correctly

### Frontend (React Native)

- **Status**: âœ… Running on `exp://172.16.0.59:8081`
- **Platform Support**: iOS, Android, and Web
- **API Connection**: Configured for local IP address

## ðŸ“± How to Test the Payment Features

### Using the React Native App:

1. **Start the app**: Scan the QR code or use simulator
2. **Login**: Use existing credentials (Admin or Salesperson role)
3. **Navigate**: Go to Payments section in the bottom navigation
4. **Test Summary**:
   - View summary cards
   - Click each card to see detailed modals
   - Verify data accuracy
5. **Test History**:
   - Switch to "History" tab
   - Try different sorting options
   - Test filtering by customer, date, amount
   - Click any entry to see details

### API Testing:

```bash
# Test API root
curl http://172.16.0.59:8000/api/

# Test payment summary (requires authentication)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://172.16.0.59:8000/api/payments/summary/
```

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps for Full Testing

1. **Login to App**: Use the login credentials for your test user
2. **Create Test Data**:
   - Add some products if needed
   - Create a few sales with different payment statuses
   - Add some payment records
3. **Verify Payment Summary**: Check that calculations are correct
4. **Test Payment History**: Ensure sorting and filtering work as expected
5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test on both iOS and Android if possible
