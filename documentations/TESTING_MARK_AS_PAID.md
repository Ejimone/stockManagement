# Testing the "Mark as Paid" Feature

## Current Status

I've implemented and debugged the "Mark as Paid" feature. Here's what has been done:

### Changes Made:

1. **My Sales Page (`frontend/app/(sales)/sales/index.tsx`)**:

   - Added debug logging to console for payment status
   - Made buttons always visible for debugging (they show payment status)
   - Green button for partial/unpaid sales, gray button showing current status for others
   - Increased button size for better visibility

2. **Sale Detail Page (`frontend/app/(sales)/sales/[id].tsx`)**:

   - Button always visible in Payment Information section
   - Green for eligible sales, gray showing current status for others
   - Proper API integration with `updateSalePaymentStatus`

3. **Debugging Features Added**:
   - Console logging for payment status
   - Buttons always visible (color-coded by eligibility)
   - Clear visual indicators

## How to Test:

### Step 1: Start the Application

```bash
cd /Users/evidenceejimone/daddy/frontend
npm start
```

### Step 2: Login as a Salesperson

Use any of these test accounts:

- `john.doe@jonkech.com`
- `jane.smith@jonkech.com`
- `mike.johnson@jonkech.com`
- `evidence@gmail.com`

### Step 3: Navigate to "My Sales"

- Look for the sales list
- Each sale should now show a button in the footer
- Green button = "Mark as Paid" (for partial/unpaid)
- Gray button = Shows current status (for already paid sales)

### Step 4: Test Available Sales

We have these test sales in the database:

- **Sale #30**: Status "Partial", Amount $36.00, Balance $15.00
- **Sale #29**: Status "Unpaid", Amount $281.99, Balance $281.99
- **Sale #28**: Status "Partial", Amount $159.98, Balance $9.98
- **Sale #27**: Status "Partial", Amount $300,000.00, Balance $10,000.00

### Step 5: Test the Functionality

1. Find a sale with "Partial" or "Unpaid" status
2. Click the green "Mark as Paid" button
3. Confirm in the dialog
4. The sale should update to "Paid" status
5. The receipt should automatically reflect the new status

### Step 6: Test Sale Detail Page

1. Click on any sale to view details
2. In the Payment Information section, you'll see the button
3. Same functionality as the list view

## What You Should See:

### In Console (Browser Dev Tools):

```
Sale item: {id: 30, payment_status: "Partial", canMarkAsPaid: true}
Sale item: {id: 29, payment_status: "Unpaid", canMarkAsPaid: true}
Sale item: {id: 28, payment_status: "Partial", canMarkAsPaid: true}
```

### In UI:

- **My Sales List**: Each sale has a button in the footer area
- **Sale Detail**: Button appears below the payment information
- **Buttons are color-coded**: Green for actionable, gray for informational

## API Endpoint:

The button calls: `PATCH /api/sales/{id}/payment-status/`

## Expected Behavior:

1. Button only functional for partial/unpaid sales
2. Confirmation dialog before updating
3. Success message after update
4. UI refreshes to show new status
5. Receipt automatically updates with new payment information

## Troubleshooting:

If you still don't see buttons:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're logged in as a salesperson
3. Check that you have sales data
4. Look for the console logs showing payment statuses

The debug version now makes buttons always visible, so you should definitely see them even if they're not functional for certain sales.
