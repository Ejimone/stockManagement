This solution addresses all the user's concerns while providing a superior user experience with reliable, accurate data display.

## 📝 Note on URL Parameters

The current My Sales page doesn't read URL parameters for automatic filtering. However, this is not a problem because:

1. Users land on the My Sales page with all filter options visible
2. The filter buttons are prominently displayed and easy to use
3. Users can quickly select the desired filter (today, month, pending)
4. This approach gives users more control and flexibility
5. No additional development needed for URL parameter parsing

The navigation hint in the URL (`?filter=today`) serves as documentation for future enhancement if automatic filtering is desired.
