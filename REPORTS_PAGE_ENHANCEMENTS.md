# Reports Page Enhancement Documentation

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive enhancements made to the Reports page (`frontend/app/(sales)/reports/index.tsx`) to improve interactivity and user experience.

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Responsive Scrollable Sales Chart

**Problem**: The chart was fixed-width and couldn't display long data series properly.

**Solution**:

- Wrapped `LineChart` in a horizontal `ScrollView`
- Made chart width responsive: `Math.max(screenWidth - 32, reportsData.chart_data.length * 50)`
- Added horizontal scroll indicator for better UX

**Code Changes**:

```tsx
<ScrollView horizontal showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={true}>
  <LineChart
    data={chartData}
    width={Math.max(screenWidth - 32, reportsData.chart_data.length * 50)}
    height={220}
    // ... other props
  />
</ScrollView>
```

### 2. Clickable Payment Status Breakdown

**Problem**: Payment status items were static and couldn't be explored further.

**Solution**:

- Made each status item clickable with `TouchableOpacity`
- Added `handlePaymentStatusClick` function to fetch sales by payment status
- Implemented modal to display filtered sales list
- Added navigation to individual sale details

**Features**:

- Click any payment status (Paid, Partial, Unpaid) to see all sales with that status
- Modal displays comprehensive sale information
- Each sale in modal is clickable for detailed view
- Clean modal UI with close button and proper styling

**Code Changes**:

```tsx
<TouchableOpacity
  key={status.payment_status}
  style={styles.statusItem}
  onPress={() => handlePaymentStatusClick(status.payment_status)}
  activeOpacity={0.7}
>
  {/* Status content */}
  <Ionicons name="chevron-forward" size={16} color="#6b7280" />
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### 3. Interactive Top Selling Products

**Problem**: Products were displayed as static items without interaction options.

**Solution**:

- Made each product clickable with multiple action options
- Added action sheet with "View Product Details" and "Create Sale" options
- Created dedicated product detail page for salespersons
- Integrated with sale creation workflow

**Features**:

- Click any product to see action options
- "View Product Details": Navigate to product information page
- "Create Sale": Pre-populate sale creation with selected product
- Product detail page shows stock levels, pricing, and sale creation option

**Code Changes**:

```tsx
<TouchableOpacity
  key={product.product__sku}
  style={styles.topProductItem}
  onPress={() =>
    handleProductClick(product.product__sku, product.product__name)
  }
  activeOpacity={0.7}
>
  {/* Product content */}
  <Ionicons name="chevron-forward" size={16} color="#6b7280" />
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### 4. Clickable Recent Activity

**Problem**: Recent sales and payments were display-only.

**Solution**:

- Made recent sales clickable to view detailed information
- Enhanced with receipt preview, payment status, and credit information
- Sales cannot be deleted by salespersons (read-only for data integrity)
- Added visual indicators for clickable items

**Features**:

- Click any recent sale to view full sale details
- Access to receipt preview and payment information
- View credit/balance information for unpaid sales
- Proper permission handling (no delete access for salespersons)

**Code Changes**:

```tsx
<TouchableOpacity
  key={sale.id}
  style={styles.activityItem}
  onPress={() => handleActivitySaleClick(sale.id)}
  activeOpacity={0.7}
>
  {/* Sale content */}
  <Ionicons name="chevron-forward" size={16} color="#6b7280" />
</TouchableOpacity>
```

  const products = response.results || response;
  const foundProduct = products.find((p: Product) => p.sku === productSku);
  // Handle found product
};
```

### 3. Enhanced Sale Creation Integration

```tsx
// Updated to handle both ID and SKU preselection
useEffect(() => {
  if (params.preselectedProductId) {
    // Handle by ID
  }
